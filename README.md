# Truth-table-for-Car-Security-System
This is a small project which I do in "Digital System Design 2" class. 

For this project, I conducted an in-depth study of the concepts and methodologies presented in Microprocessor Design: Principles and Practices with VHDL by Enoch O. Hwang, focusing specifically on Section 2.9, titled “Example: Designing a Car Security System.” 

This section provided valuable insights into practical system design using VHDL, which greatly informed my understanding and approach. Following my research, I applied the knowledge I had gained by using the Quartus II design software to simulate the system's functionality and verify the expected behavior of the proposed security mechanism.
